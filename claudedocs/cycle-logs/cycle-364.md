# Cycle 364: Array window/slide methods — SKIPPED

## Date
2026-02-13

## Scope
Array window/slide methods (windows, sliding_pairs, pairwise) were already implemented in previous cycles.

## Decision
SKIP — Feature already exists. `windows`, `each_cons`, `each_slice`, and `pairwise` are all implemented.

## Next Cycle Recommendation
- Cycle 365: Integer binary methods — popcount, bit_length, to_binary_string
