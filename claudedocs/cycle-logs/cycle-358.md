# Cycle 358: Unused parameter detection — SKIPPED

## Date
2026-02-13

## Scope
Unused parameter detection was already implemented in v0.49 as part of the `BindingTracker` system. Parameters are tracked as bindings and reported as `unused_binding` warnings when unused.

## Decision
SKIP — Feature already exists. No changes needed.

## Next Cycle Recommendation
- Cycle 359: Single-arm match detection (suggest if-let)
